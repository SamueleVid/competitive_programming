# 💻 Competitive programming 🥇

Here are stored the solutions of some of the problems I've solved as part of my training for [OII (Italian Olympiad in Informatics)](https://www.olimpiadi-informatica.it).

### 🚀 How to navigate
📁 The solutions are organized first by website and then by the problem's name. <br>
👥 There can be multiple solutions for the same problem, as for showing different methods or for displaying the solution of a subtask. <br>
🚷 The code is not meant to be user friendly, the older you go and the more unreadable it gets! <br>

### ⛔ Use wisely
Please refrain from using this repo for blindly copy-pasting a solution, instead use this as an opportunity to learn after having tried to solve the task yourself.

### 📚 Further information
Although it's written in Italian, I've laid down some notes on most of the solutions present in this repo.
Again, the purpose of the below documents is not to communicate and share my results, but to self-reflect on the problems and track my progress. <br>
* [Appunti](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vP0bBrg6piIZxfkjJVmWQSFAIC9XoP5iAeK_Glv_8K0/edit?usp=sharing): a collection of detailed solutions, which highlights the my merits and mistakes, and what I learnt during the problem-solving process. This was written between summer 2023 and the start of summer 2024. The aim was to help me train for OII 2023 and to be advanced to play in international competitions (failed horribly).
* [Appunti 2.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImULS62rwmQMRuGroFoUZ4Sq1sJ91idMmE3fOB3_hKg/edit?usp=sharing): a collections of interesting techniques and unique methods, aimed to widen my problem-solving skillset. The writing of this document started in summer 2024 and it's still ongoing. The aim is to help me train for OII 2024 (failed horribly).
